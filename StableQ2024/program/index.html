  <p><b>Talk Title: Modeling the Performance of Large-scale Quantum Computers </b></p>
  <p><b> Speaker: John Gamble (IonQ) </b></p>
  <p><b>Speaker Bio:</b> John Gamble obtained his PhD in Physics in 2013 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, specializing in the theory of quantum computing and solid state physics. Gamble has been an active researcher in quantum computing ever since, first as a Harry S. Truman Fellow (and later Technical Staff) at Sandia National Laboratories, a Quantum Engineer at Microsoft Quantum, and most recently forming and leading the Architecture &amp; Performance group at IonQ. Gamble has delivered numerous invited and contributed technical talks and seminars, written extensively and continuously since obtaining his PhD, and is the inventor of multiple patents within the domain of quantum computing. In his current role, he oversees future architectures as well as the characterization, modeling, and optimization of as-built quantum information processors, actively pushing the cutting edge of large-scale quantum information processing. </p>
  <p><b>Talk Abstract: </b> Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize the way we solve many problems, ranging from analyzing chemical reactions to cryptography. IonQ’s commercial quantum computers use trapped ions as qubits, featuring high-fidelity operations across long chains of all-to-all connected qubits. In this talk, I will describe how IonQ’s hardware works and highlight recent machine performance results, with a special focus on modeling and simulation of imperfections. Scaling to the many-qubit regime necessitates different noise modeling techniques, and the complexities involved can lead to model violation and unpredicted machine behavior. In addition to both component- and application-level benchmarking and simulation, I will highlight recent results on modeling non-Markovian effects, a hopeful approach to building predictive models that apply to many-qubit processors. </p>

  <p><b>Talk Title: A Prescriptive Definition of Resiliency for Dependable Classical-Quantum Computer Systems Engineering</b></p>
  <p><b> Speaker: Santiago Núñez-Corrales (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) </b></p>
  <p><b>Speaker Bio:</b> Santiago Núñez-Corrales, Ph.D. serves as Quantum Lead Research Scientist at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). He also serves as faculty affiliate at the Illinois Quantum Information Science and Technology Center (IQUIST), the Center for Global Studies (CGS) and Illinois Informatics at the same institution. His expertise includes research computing and quantum programming language design, building digital twins of superconducting quantum devices, devising distributed quantum computation protocols, HPC-QPU integration, and dependable classical-quantum computer systems engineering. Dr. Núñez-Corrales obtained his doctoral degree in Informatics and a minor in Global Studies from UIUC, and a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering from the Costa Rica Institute of Technology.</p>
  <p><b>Talk Abstract: </b>As quantum processing units become more affordable and accessible, we will face new challenges during their integration with classical HPC resources. These challenges arise from HPC-QPU integration toward being a socio-technical systems problem well beyond technology stacks; introducing quantum computers into research facilities and data centers involves processes, people and practices. We call this new area Dependable Classical-Quantum Computer Systems Engineering (DCQCES), an emerging body of theory and practice centered on their resiliency, reproducibility and security. In this talk, we will concentrate on resiliency as an property of HPC-QPU systems that can be engineered proactively, instead of reacting to the needs created by technological change across on-premise installation, classical-quantum stack integration, system operations, user support and research consulting. We will discuss how concepts and methods from civil engineering provide a sound qualitative and quantitative definition of resiliency that can be used to understand the impact of unexpected events and engineering decisions across a system, as well as how changes in one level of HPC-QPU technology stacks ripple through layers above and modulate the entire system: we seek to make system classical quantum systems and their operation designable, predictable and measurable tasks. Finally, we delineate the boundaries of DCQCES in terms of community efforts required to develop a coherent research agenda in tandem with the evolution of quantum technologies.</p>

  <p><b>Talk Abstract: </b> As quantum computers evolve, the increasing number of qubits offers great potential for more complex computations. However, high error rates continue to limit the size of quantum circuits that can be reliably executed, leading to low throughput and inefficient resource utilization. This talk will explore two complementary strategies to address these limitations: quantum circuit cutting and parallel quantum job scheduling.</p>

  <p><b>Talk Abstract: </b> Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) represent a promising class of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) algorithms with transformative potential across various domains. However, their effective implementation must address inherent quantum noise throughout the system stack.  In this talk, I will present our research group’s efforts to enhance QNN performance by tackling these noise challenges through advancements in algorithm design, compilation, and model training, focusing on key metrics such as accuracy, fairness, and security. I will begin by discussing robust QNN algorithm designs, including supervised, unsupervised, and transfer learning models. Next, I will introduce our automated QNN compilation framework, which ensures fairness and accuracy when deploying QNNs on NISQ machines. Finally, I will explore adversarial threats to QNNs, specifically backdoor attacks implanted during QNN training, along with potential defense strategies. Throughout the talk, I will share key techniques, insights, and lessons learned from each project, with the goal of advancing more resilient and secure QNNs.</p>

  <p><b>Talk Title: Enhancing Quantum Error Mitigation with Circuit Cutting </b></p>
  <p><b> Speaker: Ji Liu (Argonne National Laboratory) </b></p>

His research interests include developing open-source software stacks for quantum compiler optimizations, application/hardware-specific optimization techniques, and advanced noise mitigation techniques for NISQ systems.

  <p><b>Talk Abstract: </b> Quantum error mitigation is crucial in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. As we strive for practical quantum advantage in the near term, it has become an indispensable component. While various error mitigation techniques have been proposed, many rely on error detection or measurement subcircuits that introduce additional noise, limiting their effectiveness. On near-term devices with limited qubit connectivity, the extra swaps needed further increase the noise associated with these error mitigation subcircuits. In this talk, we will explore approaches that utilize circuit cutting to simulate error mitigation subcircuits classically. This allows for near-ideal execution of the subcircuits, reducing additional noise and enhancing overall performance. Specifically, we will present techniques applied to Pauli check sandwiching, virtual distillation, and QuTracer—an error mitigation framework based on qubit subsetting. We will demonstrate how these methods can significantly improve error mitigation on NISQ devices. </p>

  <p><b>Talk Abstract: </b> Neutral atom arrays are gaining traction in quantum computing for their scalability, particularly with the advent of reconfigurable atom arrays (RAAs) or field programmable qubit arrays (FPQAs), which allow atom movement during circuit execution. This talk presents two contributions leveraging this architecture to enhance quantum circuit performance. First, Atomique is a compilation framework for RAAs, optimizing qubit mapping, atom movement, and gate scheduling. Using MAX k-Cut for qubit placement and parallel gate scheduling, Atomique reduces circuit depth and two-qubit gates across diverse benchmarks compared to fixed atom arrays and superconducting systems. Second, Q-Pilot introduces flying ancillas—movable atoms used as dynamic ancilla qubits—to optimize qubit connectivity in FPQAs. Inspired by FPGA routing, Q-Pilot achieves significant depth reductions, particularly in quantum simulation and QAOA circuits. These works highlight the potential of RAAs and FPQAs in enabling more efficient and reliable quantum computation through dynamic qubit connectivity. </p>

  <p><b>Talk Abstract: </b> As quantum computing rapidly advances, its near-term applications are becoming increasingly evident. However, the high cost and under-utilization of quantum resources are prompting a shift from single-user to multi-user access models. In a multi-tenant environment, where multiple users share one quantum computer, protecting user confidentiality becomes crucial. The varied uses of quantum computers increase the risk that sensitive data encoded by one user could be compromised by others, rendering the protection of data integrity and confidentiality essential. In the evolving quantum computing landscape, it is imperative to study these security challenges within the scope of realistic threat model assumptions, wherein an adversarial user can mount practical attacks without relying on any heightened privileges afforded by physical access to a quantum computer or rogue cloud services. In this talk, we demonstrate the potential of crosstalk as an attack vector for the first time on a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) machine, that an adversarial user can exploit within a multi-tenant quantum computing model. The proposed side-channel attack is conducted with minimal and realistic adversarial privileges, with the overarching aim of uncovering the quantum algorithm being executed by a victim. Crosstalk signatures are used to estimate the presence of CNOT gates in the victim circuit, and subsequently, this information is encoded and classified by a graph-based learning model to identify the victim quantum algorithm. When evaluated on up to 336 benchmark circuits, our attack framework is found to be able to unveil the victim's quantum algorithm with up to 85.7% accuracy.</p>

  <p><b>Talk Abstract: </b> Quantum computing presents promising solutions for electronic structure and excited state problems, yet traditional methods like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) encounter difficulties such as deep quantum circuits and optimization challenges for quantum chemistry problems. In this talk, I present quantum information-informed algorithms that significantly enhance the efficiency of quantum chemistry calculations by reducing the circuit complexity. The PermVQE approach leverages quantum information to optimize qubit permutations to localize correlations, thereby reducing circuit depth and improving noise resilience. ClusterVQE utilizes mutual information and graph theory to partition qubit space into entangled clusters, enabling precise simulations of larger systems with fewer qubits. Finally, the Quantum Davidson algorithm extends the quantum Krylov subspace method, employing a pre-conditioned iterative expansion that accelerates convergence on excited states with shallower circuits. </p>

  <p><b>Talk Abstract: </b> This paper addresses frequency crowding constraints in modular quantum architecture design, focusing on the SNAIL-based quantum modules. Two key objectives are explored. First, we present physics-informed design constraints by describing a physical model for realizable gates within a SNAIL module and building a fidelity model using error budgeting derived from device characteristics. Second, we tackle the allocation problem by analyzing the impact of frequency crowding on gate fidelity as the radix of the module increases. We explore whether the gate fidelity can be preserved with a discrete set of qubit frequencies while adhering to defined separation thresholds. This work offers insights into novel quantum architectures and coupled optimization techniques to mitigate the effects of unstable noise and improve overall gate performance. </p>

  <p><b>Talk Abstract: </b> Quantum computing offers promise for solving problems beyond classical capabilities, but its effectiveness is hindered by noise and high error rates in superconducting quantum computers. These issues, exacerbated by nearest-neighbor connectivity, necessitate extensive routing, leading to decoherence and multiple swap operations. We introduce PruningQC, a novel method that optimizes circuit efficiency by removing redundant gates in measurement subsetting, reducing noise, and minimizing circuit depth. By selectively measuring specific qubits, PruningQC identifies and eliminates dispensable gates without affecting outcomes, thereby enhancing quantum computing performance. Evaluations on three IBM 127-qubit machines show that PruningQC improves success rates by an average of 17.5 times over full measurement methods and 2.1 times over partial measurement techniques. This improvement is due to a 50% reduction in circuit depth and a significant decrease in gate counts. PruningQC can also be integrated with quantum error correction strategies, advancing quantum computing efficiency. </p>
