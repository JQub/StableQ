As we enter the Quantum Utility era, high performance, stability, and reliability are key requirements for unleashing the power of quantum computing for varied applications, from chemistry, economy, and materials to healthcare. StableQ focuses on stability issues caused by the unstable hardware noise in quantum computing. This workshop was proposed to develop an open platform to present the unstable issue to the quantum computing and computing architecture research community, report the state-of-the-art development efforts, exchange ideas and practices, and foster research collaboration to develop novel techniques to address the unstable noise issue and provide a reproducible quantum computing architecture. We aim to bring together experts and researchers from different backgrounds to explore and share their insights on this critical problem. We expect to discuss different approaches to mitigating noise, including error correction techniques, noise-reducing algorithms, and hardware improvements.
