We are currently living in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, where noise and scalability are well-known and crucial issues. We have been witnessing the rapid development of superconducting quantum computers, which gradually alleviates scalability issues where we have quantum computer with 1121 qubits from IBM. However, the high noise in quantum computing is still a barrier to the use of quantum computing in real-world applications. For ibm_belem processor, the qubits error is at the level of 10^-4 to 10^-2.
Although they have great potential to work well on a fixed noise level, the change of noise will make the pre-designed noise-aware solution useless and incur high overhead for solution adaptation. Unfortunately, the noises on quantum devices are unstable.
This workshop is proposed to develop an open platform to present the unstable issue to the quantum computing research community, report the state-of-the-art development efforts, exchange ideas and practices, and foster research collaboration to develop novel techniques to address the unstable noise issue and provide a reproducible quantum computing system.

<h4>Objectives</h4>
<p>
The objective of the proposed workshop on the unstable noise of quantum computing is to address one of the most significant challenges in the development of quantum computing, which is the issue of unstable noise. The workshop aims to bring together experts and researchers from different backgrounds to explore and share their insights on this critical problem. The objective is to provide a platform to discuss different approaches to mitigating noise, including error-correction techniques, noise-reducing algorithms, and hardware improvements.
