The first "StableQ: Quantum System Stability and Reproducibility Workshop" was hosted at IEEE Quantum Week in Bellevue, Washington on Sep 17–22, 2023. In the 1st  StableQ workshop, we accepted 7 published papers and invited 1 keynote talk as well as 4 contribution talks. The presentations were given by people from federal agencies (e.g., NSF, ORNL, PNNL), industry (e.g., IBM, IonQ, Zapata Computing), and academia (e.g., MIT, Imperial College London, Johns Hopkins University). The event had over 80-person times in attendance.

Quantum computing architectures and systems have rapidly developed in recent years. In the past year, after the StableQ workshop, we have witnessed the scale-up of quantum processors, new quantum devices, and a lot of new potential applications. Stability and reproducibility issues still exist, and finding solutions becomes more challenging due to the growing complexity of hardware (e.g., large scale, heterogeneity). In the StableQ workshop this year, we expect to solicit new solutions to address the stability and reproducibility issues, and we believe this topic will resonate with the MICRO community and its interest in novel architecture approaches to solving challenging problems.
