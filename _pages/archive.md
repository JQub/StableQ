The first "StableQ: Quantum System Stability and Reproducibility Workshop" was hosted at IEEE Quantum Week in Bellevue, Washington on Sep 17–22, 2023. In the 1st  StableQ workshop, we accepted 7 published papers and invited 1 keynote talk as well as 4 contribution talks. The presentations were given by people from federal agencies (e.g., NSF, ORNL, PNNL), industry (e.g., IBM, IonQ, Zapata Computing), and academia (e.g., MIT, Imperial College London, Johns Hopkins University). The event had over 80-person times in attendance.

Quantum computing architectures and systems have rapidly developed in recent years. In the past year, after the StableQ workshop, we have witnessed the scale-up of quantum processors, new quantum devices, and a lot of new potential applications. Stability and reproducibility issues still exist, and finding solutions becomes more challenging due to the growing complexity of hardware (e.g., large scale, heterogeneity). In the StableQ workshop this year, we expect to solicit new solutions to address the stability and reproducibility issues, and we believe this topic will resonate with the MICRO community and its interest in novel architecture approaches to solving challenging problems.

  <p><strong>StableQ</strong> is a workshop dedicated to the stability and reproducibility of quantum computing systems. It brings together researchers across the stack — from devices and control, to architecture, compilers, algorithms, benchmarking, error mitigation, and error correction — to share practical methods, datasets, and evaluations.</p>

  <p><strong>Latest edition:</strong> StableQ 2024 was held on <strong>November 3, 2024</strong>, in <strong>Austin, Texas, USA</strong>, co‑located with <strong>MICRO 2024</strong> at the <strong>AT&amp;T Hotel and Conference Center</strong>. See the <a href="https://stableq.org/StableQ2024/">2024 program and materials</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Origins:</strong> The inaugural workshop took place during <strong>IEEE Quantum Week (QCE)</strong> in Bellevue, Washington (September 17–22, 2023), bringing together participants from government, industry, and academia. It featured peer‑reviewed papers, a keynote, and contributed talks. See the <a href="https://stableq.github.io/">2023 archive</a>.</p>
