We invite submissions to the 2nd Quantum System Stability and Reproducibility (StableQ) workshop, jointly held at the IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO 2024). The workshop will provide a platform for researchers and industry experts to present and discuss the latest advances in mitigating unstable noise in quantum computing.

<h4>Paper Submission</h4>
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Different approaches to mitigating noise across the quantum computing stack, including hardware improvements, architecture designs, noise-reducing algorithms, and error-correction techniques.
* Novel quantum architectures and coupled optimization techniques to mitigate the effects of unstable noise.
* Quantum error correction codes and fault-tolerant quantum computing.
* Machine learning for quantum noise mitigation.
* Benchmarking and characterization of noise in quantum computing systems.
* Applications of quantum computing in noisy environments.
* Quantum error suppression and noise-tolerant quantum algorithms.
* Hybrid classical-quantum algorithms for noise mitigation.
* Quantum error models and noise simulations.

<h4>Important Dates</h4>

* Submission Deadline: August 30, 2024 (AOE)
* Notification of Acceptance: September 15, 2024
* Physical Workshop: November 3, 2024

<h4>Submission Guidelines</h4>
<div class="justified-text">
<p>
We welcome submissions of original research papers and papers that present novel ideas and perspectives on unstable noise in quantum computing from the architecture and system perspectives. Submissions should follow the MICRO 2024 conference format and must not exceed 4 pagesÂ without references. Please submit your contribution work at the submission site on <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=stableq2024">Easychair</a>.
</p>
<p>
The workshop's program committee will peer-review all submissions. Accepted papers will be presented in the workshop as oral presentations. We do not put papers in the ACM or IEEE digital libraries. Therefore, papers submitted to the event can be submitted to other venues without restrictions.
