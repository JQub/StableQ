We invite submissions to the StableQ workshop, which is jointly held at the IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture. The workshop will provide a platform for researchers and industry experts to present and discuss the latest advances in mitigating unstable noise in quantum computing.  
</p>
</div>

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Different approaches to mitigating noise across the quantum computing stack, including hardware improvements, architecture designs, noise-reducing algorithms, and error-correction techniques.
* Novel quantum architectures and coupled optimization techniques to mitigate the effects of unstable noise.
* Quantum error correction codes and fault-tolerant quantum computing.
* Machine learning for quantum noise mitigation.
* Benchmarking and characterization of noise in quantum computing systems.
* Applications of quantum computing in noisy environments.
* Quantum error suppression and noise-tolerant quantum algorithms.
* Hybrid classical-quantum algorithms for noise mitigation.
* Quantum error models and noise simulations.

We welcome submissions of original research papers, as well as papers that present novel ideas and perspectives on the topic of unstable noise in quantum computing from the architecture and system perspectives. Submissions should follow the MICRO 2024 conference format and must not exceed 4 pages, including references. All submissions will undergo a peer-review process by the workshopâ€™s program committee. Accepted papers will be presented in the workshop as oral presentations or posters.
