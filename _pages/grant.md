## Travel Grant · Q-CORE @ QCE 2025

The Q-CORE Travel Grant is designed to encourage and support student participation in the Q-CORE workshop at QCE 2025. We aim to make it easier for students—especially those who might otherwise face financial barriers—to attend and engage with the community.

Special consideration will be given to undergraduate students, early-stage graduate students, first-time QCE attendees, and those from institutions with limited research funding in quantum technology. By supporting their participation, we hope to foster the exchange of scientific ideas, stimulate interest in dependable quantum-classical systems, and inspire the next generation of researchers.

You do not need to be a paper author or presenter to apply. Grants will reimburse documented expenses post-conference in accordance with funding guidelines.

<details>
<summary><strong>When will I receive the reimbursement?</strong></summary>

Reimbursements are typically processed **within 4–6 weeks** after your documents are approved.  
Payments will be made via **international wire transfer** or **PayPal** (depending on location and institutional restrictions).  
Detailed instructions will be included in your award notification.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is Fly America compliance mandatory?</strong></summary>

**Yes.** If your travel is funded by this grant, the **Fly America Act** requires you to use a U.S. airline whenever possible.  
If no U.S. carrier is available for a flight segment, you must:

- Provide a screenshot showing available flights  
- Explain the situation in the remarks section of your reimbursement form  

Failure to follow this rule may result in partial or no reimbursement for that flight.
